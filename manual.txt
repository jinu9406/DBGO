** Our database is based on MySQL 5.7.

1. Download everything in the folder.


2. We use 'php' as an application so it is needed to start 'apache'.

   (** 'Sites/index.html' is the first page of our website.
   Once you access to '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost', this page will be shown.)


3. How 'php' can access to the database is,
   to set a username to 'root' and a password to 'Hisnet12!'.
   Also, the name of the database must be 'genie'.


4. Everything is done!

   (** Note that every scenario should be executed in order
   to get an expected output especially from #51 to #55 scenarios.)
